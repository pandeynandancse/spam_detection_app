## Overview
This is a simple spam detection application developed using sklearn. The trained model (`model/model.h5`) takes string of message as an input and predicts the class of message as spam or not spam. It's a multiclass problem. Dataset has been taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
